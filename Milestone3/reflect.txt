also really good experience. Had some bad experiences and had some really good times. I came across tons of concepts
which made me keen to learn more.

The milestone 3 was pretty hard hard for me as I submitted 2 milestones with ease but faced some real problems in solving 
the milestone 3. I Hope i got it correct somehow. 

I want to thank you prof. for giving such time after me and giving feedbacks for every workshops and make a thrive
for the best. 

Thank you
