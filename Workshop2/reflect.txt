
The workshop 2 was pretty tough for me as I use to get confuse in class and many other things
but by looking at the notes and lectures i found my way out.

Primarily, I had problems executing functions std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point clockStartTime/clockEndTime and std::chrono::steady_clock::duration
as I was doing and assigning values and making class wrong and maybe my method was not good enough for doing it in this particular
workshop but looking at the notes and recorded lectures helps a lot. I alsoo wasted a lot of my time on nanoseconds attribute, though
it was so simple it was just endtime-starttime but I was just overthinking and complicating it. Although I didn't faced alot difficulties 
in ProteinDatabase module but it was bit hard to design the function that reads the file and count the strings with allocating string memory and
re-reading the file but somehow with trial and error method i overcame that. One of my friend also helped me in that to understand the concept
properly with certain examples. Also learned about move assignment operator and construct. I transferred the memory to new instance to save time
coping all the resources.This is very handy in the situations where, object is about to expire and the resources needs to be allocated to a new 
class object.

Talking about the difference between cpoy and move operations, the Copy operations only copy the data of one object to another, leaving the original
data member still existing while the Move allows the original data to be moved instead of just copied to discourage floating data within the memory.
Overall it was good learning a lot and doing the workshop.

Thank you.
