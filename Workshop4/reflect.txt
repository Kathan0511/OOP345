but by looking at the notes and lectures i found my way out.

In this workshop, I learned how create a class that has contains a composition. A composition involves complete ownership of another 
class. The composer type is responsible for managing the composing type and That means the composing type must contain the value of an one 
or more objects of the composing type either dynamically allocated or statically allocated. Whilst To copy the contents of an 
object with a composition relationship, the memory associated with the composing type within the current object must be deallocated with the delete 
expression. Memory is then reallocated for the composing type to be able to store the same amount of objects of composing type as the right operand.
The logic between the move operators in a composition and an aggregation is very similar to each other. All members are shallow copied. 
In composition, the address of the dynamic array holding composing objects is copied to the current object. In aggregation, the address of the dynamic 
array holding addresses of aggregatee types is copied to the current object.

Overall it was great learning experience and doing the workshop was fun.

Thank you.
