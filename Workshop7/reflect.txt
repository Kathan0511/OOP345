I got my hands on how to use STL containers and algorithms effectively in the code. overall the workshop
was pretty easy and dooable but the most tedious task to perform was selecting perfect function to use as per
the need from the STL containers and algorithms library. It took sometime & was difficult to figure out placing 
the fuctions inCollection, for_each and getSongsForArtist but looking at lecture and course notes I figured it out.

The STL functions I used in this workshop were:
-- cleanAlbum with for_each 
I used this function as after a trial and error method I came to know that this is the only function that helps
me modify but can also help me for CleanAblum where other functions were not working perfectly here.
-- Used inCollection with find_if
For this I took reference from one of my classmate and he gave me list of some functions and from trying all of them
this function helped me to get through it.
getSongsForArist with count_if
-- For this I tried using copy_if function as I thought it will be a good fit but I was not able to execute
it properly so I tried using count_if and it worked for me.

The advantages of using STL algorithms instead of implementing the functionality loops by myself is it saves a
lot of time and also does not have write pages of code, it is also considered a great practice as this method
is more efficient while it also reduces alot of looping statements in code. 

Overall, working on the workshop I learned a lot of new concepts
The workshop was pretty much easy but gained alot of knowledge.
Thank you.
