This workshop helped me a lot summarizing all the concepts and plots of last 
semester as we need to implement some of the old concepts.

As per my understanding Internal linkage refers or works with everything insidethe scope whilst External linkage refers or works with the entire program. The internal 
linkage is put in action by the use of static variable as variable with the static key remains
always in the program memory. I also came across that how helpful it is to pass arguments of main func. using command line
For Eg: Here we used static variable to count the occurance of the function in display function
indeed if you are defining static variable there is no use of defining Global or class variables.

I had to make small small changes in part 2 for submitting like creating constructor & destructor, copy assignment operator, copy constructor, static variable and allocating
dynamic memory.
-- if (Special == 'Y') {
				theSpecialPrice = true;
			}
			else {
				theSpecialPrice = false;
			}
		}
		return istr;
	}
    
-- if (theSpecialPrice) {
				cout.precision(2);
				cout.setf(ios::fixed);
				cout << Foodprice - g_dailydiscount << endl;
				cout.unsetf(ios::fixed);
			}

-- else {
			cout.width(2);
			cout.setf(ios::left);
			cout << Time << ". No Order" << endl;
		}
		Time++;
	}


Thanks a lot for explaning the concents and giving us this oppurtunity to work on such workshops.
