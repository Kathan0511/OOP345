on handeling static and dynamic allocated objects. In this workshop I also learned that how we can use Vectors effectively. 
While doing the workshop I had pretty much dificulties in working on FIle and Filesystem modules mostly
while using some certain functions but to overcome that I went through lecture recordings 
and also had some help from my online tutor for understanding clearity of my concepts and to make sure
my solution is as good as I can make it.
What happens when we don't deallocate dynamically allocated memory in vector is we will get a memory leak
and will get error in heap summary while compilation.

The function NodeType type() can know what went wrong if we make up an another solution which has functions
which finds the errors and make right the type of data that are accepted by the program by 
comparing it with given text file.

Maybe yes, we can use std::vector<sdds::Resource> vectors instead of using its 
pointer types as in both of them as vectors can enter and store any data or elements while we can also
delete the data or elements from them when necessary. And I don't know the proper reason but I
think pointers is more favorable method to use.

Overall, working on the workshop I learned a lot of new concepts and the workshop was bit time
consuming but considering it a gain.
